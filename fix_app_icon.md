# ðŸ”§ Fix LocalAlert App Icon - Step by Step Guide

## Problem
The Assets.xcassets folder exists but isn't showing up in Xcode, so you can't add your blue bell icon.

## Solution - Add Assets to Xcode Project

### Step 1: Open Xcode Project
1. Open LocalAlert.xcodeproj in Xcode
2. Make sure you can see the project navigator (left sidebar)

### Step 2: Add Assets.xcassets to Project
1. **Right-click on your project name** (LocalAlert) in the navigator
2. **Select "Add Files to LocalAlert"**
3. **Navigate to** the LocalAlert folder
4. **Find and select** `Assets.xcassets` folder
5. **Make sure "Add to target" is checked** for LocalAlert
6. **Click "Add"**

### Step 3: Verify Assets Appeared
1. You should now see `Assets.xcassets` in your project navigator
2. Click on it to expand
3. You should see `AppIcon` inside

### Step 4: Add Your Blue Bell Icon
1. **Click on `AppIcon`** in the Assets folder
2. **Drag your blue bell icon** into the appropriate icon slots
3. Xcode will automatically suggest which size each icon fits

### Step 5: Build and Test
1. **Clean build folder** (Product â†’ Clean Build Folder)
2. **Build and run** the project
3. **Check your home screen** - you should see the blue bell icon!

## Alternative: Create New Asset Catalog
If the above doesn't work:
1. **Delete the existing** Assets.xcassets folder from your project
2. **Right-click on project** â†’ "New File"
3. **Choose "Asset Catalog"**
4. **Name it "Assets"**
5. **Right-click on Assets.xcassets** â†’ "New App Icon Set"

## Need Help?
If you're still having issues, try:
1. **Restart Xcode**
2. **Check that Assets.xcassets is in the project target**
3. **Verify the folder structure is correct**

Your blue bell icon is ready - we just need to get Xcode to recognize the Assets folder!
